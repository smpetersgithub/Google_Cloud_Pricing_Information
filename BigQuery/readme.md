### Compute Pricing

This refers to the cost to **process queries**, which includes:

- SQL queries  
- User-defined functions (UDFs)  
- Scripts  
- Certain DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements  
- Certain DDL (Data Definition Language) statements

### Storage Pricing

This is the cost to **store data** that you load into BigQuery.
