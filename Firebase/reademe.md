## How do I know which pricing plan is right for me?

For detailed information about pricing plans, see Firebase pricing plans.


### Spark pricing plan

Our Spark plan is a great place to develop your app at no cost. You get all the no-cost Firebase features (Analytics, Remote Config, Crashlytics, and so on) and generous amounts of our paid infrastructure features. **However, if you exceed your Spark plan resources in a calendar month, your app will be shut off for the remainder of that month.** In addition, Google Cloud features are not available when using the Spark plan.

### Blaze pricing plan

Our Blaze plan is designed for production apps. The Blaze plan also allows you to extend your app with paid Google Cloud features. You pay only for the resources that you consume, allowing you to scale with demand. We strive to make our Blaze plan prices competitive with industry-leading cloud providers.
